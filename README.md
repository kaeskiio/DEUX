# Deux - A Card Game

## Overview
Deux is a fun and engaging card game inspired by UNO, with a unique twist. While the gameplay is similar to UNO, the only way to win is if your last card is an even-numbered card.

## Development
I developed Deux using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The core game logic, including turn-taking and special card effects, is handled by JavaScript. CSS was used to style the game interface, ensuring an engaging and visually appealing experience, while HTML structures the content and layout of the game. Together, I could recreate the classic card game feel with a modern twist.

## How to Play

### Objective
Be the first player to play all your cards, with your last card being an even card.

### Basic Rules
- Players take turns dealing.
- On your turn, match a card from your hand to the top card of the discard pile by number, color, or symbol.
- If you can't match a card, draw one from the draw pile. If the drawn card can be played, you may do so immediately; otherwise, your turn ends.
- Play continues until a player has one card left. Upon playing their final card, they must declare "Deux!" If the last card is an even number, they win. If it's odd, they must draw a card and continue playing.

### Special Cards
- **Skip:** The next player in turn misses their turn.
- **Reverse:** Reverses the order of play.
- **Draw Two:** The next player draws two cards and loses their turn.
- **Wild:** Allows you to change the current color being played.
- **Wild Draw Four:** Allows you to change the color and forces the next player to draw four cards.

### Winning the Game
- The first player to play all their cards wins, but only if their last card is an even number. If the last card is odd, the player must draw one card and continue playing.

## Strategy Tips
- Keep track of the cards that have been played to anticipate which cards remain.
- Try to hold onto at least one even card as your final card.
- Use special cards strategically to disrupt your opponentsâ€™ plans.
